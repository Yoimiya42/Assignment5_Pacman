Pacman Protocol Specification
=============================

Terminology
===========

This specification uses the terms **MUST**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** as
defined in RFC 2119 [rfc2119].

The Pacman protocol runs over both TCP and UDP, using a well known 
port 1234.
There are 12 message types:

MAZE_UPDATE

PACMAN_ARRIVED
PACMAN_LEFT
PACMAN_GO_HOME
PACMAN_DIED

FOREIGN_PACMAN_ATE_GHOST
EAT

SCORE_UPDATE
LIVES_UPDATE
STATUS_UPDATE

PACMAN_UPDATE
GHOST_UPDATE

The MAZE_UPDATE message is critical for initializing the game setup, so it MUST be sent using TCP protocol to
ensure data is not lost or corrupted. 

PACMAN_UPDATE and GHOST_UPDATE messages are sent at a high frequency, 
their function is to continuously update the game visuals, the occasional loss of a message
won't have a significant impact on the game, after all the players are unlikely to notice that. 
so they SHOULD be sent using UDP to minimize latency and overhead.

Meanwhile, the other nine messages, which corresponds to events in the game process, such as LIVES_UPDATE, SCORE_UPDATE
are also vital for the players' experience, so they SHOULD be sent via TCP protocol
to ensure these messages are reliably captured and processed when corresponding events occur.

The solution for handling possible UDP messages out-of-order, and UDP messages may overtake TCP ones, will be discussed at the end.  

Message Timing
==============

The MAZE_UPDATE message is sent at the beginning of the game to initialise maze information for two computers.

PACMAN_UPDATE and GHOST_UPDATE need to be sent at a high frequency to maintain smooth gameplay
and ensure the positions of the pacman and ghosts are updated promptly.
Considering the network speed and computational overhead, these two 
messages should be sent 20 times per second, which corresponds to sending 
every 50 milliseconds.

The other seven messages are sent when the corresponding events occur.
For instance, SCORE_UPDATE is sent when the score changes, LIVES_UPDATE when pacman loses a life, and PACMAN_ARRIVED when pacman reached another map.


Message Encoding
================
Messages are fixed format, each message follows a specific fixed 
structure where the fields have a consistent position and order, ensuring
uniformity and predictability in data representation.

Messages are encoded directly into binary format rather than in human-
readable text format such as JSON or XML, optimizing for efficiency and 
compactness. This also allows for easier parsing and serialization
/deserialization of messages.

For all floating-point values, such as the x and y coordinates and speed of Pacmon and ghosts, 
need to be represented in the IEEE 754 standard format as single-precision floating-point numbers, which will take up 32 bytes.

All integers fields in all messages are sent in a network byte order -- 
big-endian order which the most significant byte is at the beginning 
of the byte array. Here is an example of a 4-byte integer 0x04321567 

- big-endian: 0x04 0x32 0x15 0x67
- little-endian: 0x67 0x15 0x32 0x04

As a message type is fixed forward, no explicit length field is required.

Multiple messages MAY be transmitted sequentially within a single packet.
This approach can be advantageous in minimizing overhead, particularly 
when dispatching both PACMAN_UPDATE and GHOST_UPDATE messages together. 

To ensure the sanity of received values, the receiver MUST check the values through the
validation standards outlined below:

- Message Type Validation: 
  Authenticate the first 4 bits field of the message, this is an integer representing the message type, and it MUST fall within
  the range of 0 to 11.
- Field Length Validation: 
  Verify that each message has the correct length. 
  For instance, the PACMAN_UPDATE message always has 16 bytes, SCORE_UPDATE always has 4 bytes, LIFE_UPDATE always has 1 byte an so on.
  If the length of received message is not equal to the expected length, the message MUST be discarded.
- Enumeration Validation: 
  Verify that enumerated values are within the expected set. 
  For instance, the direction of the pacman and ghosts MUST fall within the range of 0 to 4.
  the mode of the ghost MUST fall within the range of 0 to 1, the status of the game MUST fall within the range of 0 to 5 and so on.
  If the values are outside the predefined range, the message MUST be discarded.
- Range Validation:
  Verify that the values, such as coordinates and speeds of the pacman and ghosts, adhere to the range defined in advance in file.
  For instance, the x  coordinates should be within the range of 0 to CANVAS_WIDTH = 650, 
  the y coordinates should be within the range of 0 to CANVAS_HEIGHT = 800.
  If the values are outside the predefined range, the message MUST be discarded.


Determining Mazes
================= 

At start stage of the game, mazes of two computers MUST be determined.
Two players can choose their own LOCAL mazes by typing "-m <mazenum>"
on the command line, mazenum is an integer from 0 to 2. If no corresponding
command input is provided, maze will be randomly selected.
Once the LOCAL maze is determined, a copy of LOCAL maze will be sent to
the other player's computer using the MAZE_UPDATE message, this maze will
be displayed as a "REMOTE" maze in the upper-right.

This message MUST be transmitted reliably and without and 
packet loss to both computers to successfully synchronize the mazes 
information.
Hence, this transmission process MUST be done over TCP.

- Protocol Type: UDP


Sequence Number
---------------
Due to the use of UDP protocol, PACMAN_UPDATE and GHOST_UPDATE messages, may be lost or arrive out of order.
If earlier messages arrive later than more recent messages, it will cause issus with position updates and animations.
To handle the issue of out-of-order messages, a sequence number is added to each PACMAN_UPDATE and GHOST_UPDATE message.
This sequence number, a 24-bit number like a timestamp that incremented by 1 for each message sent, logs the time at when the message was sent.
The receiver SHOULD establish a buffer to compare the sequence number of the received message with the previous ones.
If the latest one is smaller than any of the previous ones stored in the buffer, the message MUST be discarded.

Another issue to consider is the difference in arrival speed between UDP and TCP messages.
A UDP message might arrive before a TCP message even though they were sent at the same time.
For instance, Pacman might already have reached a position that a food item exists, but this food not displayed until after Pacman has passed it.
To avoid this issue, a buffer SHOULD be established on the receiver side. UDP messages SHOULD be deferred for processing, such as with a 5-millisecond delay, rather than being processed immediately upon arrival.
During this delay, the receiver SHOULD check for any incoming TCP messages. If any are received, they should be processed first, followed by the UDP messages.
